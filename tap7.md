# Abstract

NOTE: This TAP will be informally implemented but will not be part of the specification for TUF.

[Conformance testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformance_testing)
can determine whether an implementation meets the requirements set by a given
specification.  At this point, no tool or set of data exists to help developers
and users affirm
that an implementation of an update system behaves according to the TUF
specification. Although the reference implementation contains
[unit tests](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/tree/develop/tests)
that verify correct behavior (such as updating metadata in the expected order
and blocking known updater attacks) these unit tests only work within the
parameters of the reference implementation. This is problematic due to the
diversity of TUF implementations.

This proposal describes the design of a data configuration and format for
defining test cases that determine TUF compliance - most importantly, for
testing resilience to attacks against updaters.

The goals are to enable determination of whether or not an updater
implementation
conforms to the TUF specification, to interoperate with implementations in
diverse languages and environments, and to minimize the burden of such testing
on implementers.

# Motivation

Developers need a convenient way of verifying whether an implementation
conforms to the TUF specification, affirming that the tested
implementation meets a recognized standard of secure operation.

Up to this point, adopters of TUF who had written an implementation could only test
for conformance by (1) verifying that metadata generated in some language X
matches that of the reference implementation, and/or (2) reproducing the unit
tests of the reference implementation in language X.  In the first case, only
the metadata generated by X can be said to conform to the specifications. The client
would still need to test for the expected behavior when the generated
metadata is updated.  In the second case, the implementation is said to
conform depending on how thoroughly the unit tests are reproduced in X.
There are bound to be inconsistencies between the two sets of unit tests. Any
improvements in TUF testing or changes to the program would require
implementers to add test code in parallel.

The ability to distribute test data accompanied by prescriptions for the
behavior expected from the updater processing each test case can ensure update
behavior as intended by the designers of TUF,
and, most importantly, ensure that an updater is secure against
the types of attacks and weaknesses listed in
Section 1.5.2 of the
[TUF Specification](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/#goals-to-protect-against-specific-attacks).


# Rationale

The strategy for testing TUF conformance proposed in this TAP is to generate
sets of metadata and targets with the expectation that all implementations
should react to certain sets by successfully validating and updating, and react
to other sets by rejecting the invalid metadata or
targets. Determining which data sets an implementation accepts and which it
rejects helps to determine the implementation's TUF conformance, including
its resilience against the attacks listed in the TUF Specification (section
1.5.2).
If an updater implementation performs as prescribed in every test case, it is
likely that it complies with the TUF Specification.

For instance, a set of test data may provide metadata signed by an an untrusted
key to test whether or not the implementation will reject an untrusted signature.

While test cases may note the expected reason for an expected failure
to update, it is not expected that specific errors be raised; the only
prescription is that an updater correctly update or fail to update. TUF
conformance shouldn't depend on specific kinds of errors being communicated.

The validation behavior during testing should not vary significantly
from that in production so that test results can represent real updater
performance.

The official test cases should be publicly
available so that anyone can use them to test their updater implementation.


# Specification

The client updater implementation to be tested should operate as described in
the Client Workflow in Section 5 of the
[TUF Specification](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/#detailed-client-workflow).
Tests will verify this behavior, determining whether or not the updater defends
against attacks described in Section 1.5.2 of the TUF Specification.

The updater will be expected to reject untrustworthy metadata and targets and
accept trustworthy metadata and targets. Positive test cases will be used
to verify correct behavior in the absence of an attack.

Tests will attempt endless data attacks, indefinite freeze attacks, replay
attacks, and a variety of others discussed in the TUF Specification. The full
listing of conformance tests and expected results will be provided in
documentation
[alongside the TUF Specification](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/docs).


## Test Case Elements
Each test case will be specified with the following pieces of information:
- Description
- Expected Result
- Initial Trusted Metadata
- Repository Data
- Target to Install

### Description
The Description field will indicate the purpose of the test -- what attack it
expects to test the updater's defense against, or what problematic updater
behavior it checks for.

For example:
```
Test defense against metadata replay attacks: provide a snapshot role that
has a lower version than that already trusted by the client.
```

### Expected Result

This will be 'Success' or 'Failure'. If the value is 'Success', that will mean
that the client is expected to indicate that it was able to validate the
provided metadata and the target the updater was instructed to "install"
('Install Instruction') was deemed valid and OK to install. If the value is
'Failure', this means that the client is expected to indicate that the target
could not be installed - whether because an attack should be detected in the
metadata, or the target doesn't match values provided in the metadata,
or so on.

### Initial Trusted Metadata
This is the path to a directory containing initial metadata the updater client
will have and trust before an update is attempted. TUF always requires some
established root of trust to be present in the updater client. The common case
is generally a trustworthy root.json file that shipped with the updater. For
testing purposes, this may also be a full set of metadata that would have been
validated in a hypothetical previous update.

Metadata in the TUF specification's metadata format will be provided in the
directory, with the directory structure below. Data here should be converted to
whatever format the updater requires and delivered in the manner the updater
requires. Also provided in the indicated directory is a `keys.json` file, in
case metadata has to be converted to a different format and re-signed, as
explained [below](#keys-for-re-signing).

Additional files may appear in test data directories to support new TUF
features. See
[Adapting TAP 7 for Future Changes below](#adapting-tap-7-for-future-changes).

In most cases, the contents of the directory indicated as Initial Trusted
Metadata will simply be:
  ```
  - keys.json
  - metadata
          |- root.json
  ```

But more may be provided:
  ```
  - keys.json
  - metadata
          |- root.json
          |- timestamp.json
          |- snapshot.json
          |- targets.json
          |- <a delegated role>.json
          |- <another delegated role>.json
          |   ...
  ```

#### Keys for Re-Signing
The `keys.json` file will specify the keys used to generate the given metadata.
This information does not need to be used if the updater implementation uses
the same structure and canonicalized JSON metadata format described in the TUF
Specification and used by the TUF Reference Implementation. If metadata has to
be converted and signed over a different format for the updater, these keys can
be used to re-sign the metadata and generate equivalent metadata in the new
format.

The format of this dictionary of keys represented in `keys.json` is as follows.
(Note that the individual keys resemble ANYKEY_SCHEMA in the
[TUF format definitions](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/blob/develop/tuf/formats.py))
  ```javascript
  {
    <rolename_1>: [ // This role should be signed by these two keys:
      {'keytype': <type, e.g. 'ed25519'>,
       'keyid': <id string>,
       'keyval': {'public': <key string>, 'private': <key string>},
      },
      {'keytype': <type, e.g. 'ed25519'>,
       'keyid': <id string>,
       'keyval': {'public': <key string>, 'private': <key string>},
      }],
    <rolename_2>: [...],
    ...
  }
  ```

  This listing indicates which key(s) should be used to sign each role
  in the test metadata. Sometimes (in the case of some attacks),
  these will not be the correct keys for the role.

Here's an excerpt from a particular example:
```javascript
{
    'root': [{
      'keytype': 'ed25519',
      'keyid': '94c836f0c45168f0a437eef0e487b910f58db4d462ae457b5730a4487130f290',
      'keyval': {
        'public': 'f4ac8d95cfdf65a4ccaee072ba5a48e8ad6a0c30be6ffd525aec6bc078211033',
        'private': '879d244c6720361cf1f038a84082b08ac9cd586c32c1c9c6153f6db61b474957'}}],
    'timestamp': [{
      'keytype': 'ed25519',
      'keyid': '6fcd9a928358ad8ca7e946325f57ec71d50cb5977a8d02c5ab0de6765fef040a',
      'keyval': {
        'public': '97c1112bbd9047b1fdb50dd638bfed6d0639e0dff2c1443f5593fea40e30f654',
        'private': 'ef373ea36a633a0044bbca19a298a4100e7f353461d7fe546e0ec299ac1b659e'}}],
    ...
    'delegated_role1': [{
      'keytype': 'ed25519',
      'keyid': '8650aed05799a74f5febc9070c5d3e58d62797662d48062614b1ce0a643ee368',
      'keyval': {
        'public': 'c5a78db3f3ba96462525664e502f2e7893b81e7e270d75ffb9a6bb95b56857ca',
        'private': '134dc07435cd0d5a371d51ee938899c594c578dd0a3ab048aa70de5dd71f99f2'}}]
}
```


### Repository Data
This component of the test set is a directory of data - metadata and targets,
along with the keys used to sign the metadata - that should be made available
to the updater when it tries to update. This data should be treated normally by
the updater (i.e. not as initially-shipped, trusted data).

It is similar to Initial Trusted Metadata in its form, but will have a
`targets` directory alongside the `metadata` directory. For example:
  ```
  - keys.json
  - metadata
        |- root.json
        |- timestamp.json
        |- snapshot.json
        |- targets.json
        |- <a delegated role>.json
        |- <another delegated role>.json
        |   ...
  - targets
        |- <some_target.img>
        |-  ...
  ```
`keys.json` is as specified [above](#keys-for-re-signing).

Filepaths in the targets directory map directly to the filepaths
used to identify targets in the repository. For example, a target
identified in metadata with the filepath 'package1/tarball.tar' would
be found in 'targets/package1/tarball.tar'.



### Target to Install
The path of a target file that the updater should try to update/install, as
listed in the metadata provided. Filepaths are relative to the root of targets
directories. It is not necessary for the updater to have a notion of a
filesystem; this piece of information is intended to specify the target to
update to.



## Test Case Specification
The test cases, containing
[the elements above (see for details on each element)](#test-case-specification)
will be provided as a directory accompanied by a JSON file in the following
JSON format.

```javascript
[
  // Each test case is an element in this list.
  {
    'description': 'A description of the test case',
    'expected_result': <either 'success' or 'failure'>,
    'initial_data': <path to directory containing the metadata to use>,
    'repository_data': <path to directory containing data to use>,
    'target': <repository filepath of target to try obtaining and updating to>
  },
  {
    ...
  }
]
```

Example:
```javascript
[
{
  'description':     '0: Basic positive case, valid test data',
  'expected_result': 'success',
  'initial_data':    'test_sets/test0/initial/',
  'repository_data': 'test_sets/test0/repository/',
  'target':          'target.txt'
},
{
  'description':
     '1: replay: snapshot w/ lower version than that already trusted by client',
  'expected_result': 'failure',
  'initial_data':    'test_sets/test1/initial/',
  'repository_data': 'test_sets/test1/repository/',
  'target':          'target.txt'
},
{
  'description':
     '2: target file provided does not match hash in trustworthy metadata',
  'expected_result': 'failure',
  'initial_data':    'test_sets/test2/initial/',
  'repository_data': 'test_sets/test2/repository/',
  'target':          'target.txt'
},
{
  'description':
     '3: delegated role is signed by key no longer trusted by delegating role'
  'expected_result': 'failure',
  'initial_data':    'test_sets/test3/initial/',
  'repository_data': 'test_sets/test3/repository/',
  'target':          'target_123.txt'
},
{
  'description':     '4: Positive w/ delegations (also controls for Test 3)',
  'expected_result': 'success',
  'initial_data':    'test_sets/test3c/initial/',
  'repository_data': 'test_sets/test3c/repository/',
  'target':          'target_123.txt'
}
]
```




## Use of Test Data
Because different updaters may operate very differently, feeding the test data
to the client updater may require additional work. The
[Dealing with Implementation Restrictions](#dealing-with-implementation-restrictions)
section below addresses a variety of such scenarios in detail. Here are some
examples of what may be necessary:
 - move metadata or target files into the directory structure an updater
 implementation expects.
 - if, e.g., the updater doesn't have a notion of a filesystem, read the files
 the provided and distribute data to the updater in the manner the
 updater expects.
 - if the updater uses a different metadata format (for example, ASN.1/DER
 instead of canonical JSON -- or just a different arrangement in canonical
 JSON), translate metadata (Initial and Repository) from the format the Tester
 provides into the format the updater expects.
 - if the updater requires signatures to be over a different format, re-sign
 metadata (using `keys.json`) after translating it.


### Re-Signing Converted Metadata
If an updater implementation uses a different metadata format than that
of the test data, it is necessary to convert test metadata for the updater's
use. Further, two situations arise depending on the behavior of the updater:
1. When the updater receives the converted metadata, it converts it back to
canonical JSON and checks the signatures in this (original) format.
2. When the updater receives the converted metadata, it will not convert it
back into canonical JSON, and will expect the signatures to be over the same
new format (foreign to TUF).

In the second case, the converted metadata must also be re-signed, so that the
updater will be able to correctly validate the metadata.

For this reason, a `keys.json` file is provided with any test case metadata.
This file,
[described above](#keys-for-re-signing), indicates which keys should be used to
sign each piece of metadata, if that metadata should need to be converted and
re-signed.

For an example of how such re-signing code might look, consider the JSON-to-DER
converter `convert_signed_metadata_to_der` employed by the Uptane Reference
Implementation's current TUF fork
[here](https://github.com/awwad/tuf/blob/36dbb7b8a800dab407fe9ab961155ef0a6d9f7c9/tuf/asn1_codec.py#L156-L352).




## Adapting TAP 7 for Future Changes
Accommodating future TUF features or TAPs may require a slightly different
arrangements of test data. [TAP 4 support is provided below](#tap-4-support)
as an example. Future TAPs that affect test data should specify how test data
must be changed.

### TAP 4 Support
Operating with multiple repositories, an ability slated for addition to TUF
in [TAP 4](tap4.md), requires that test data provide for multiple repositories.
TAP 4 support expands the formats in this TAP somewhat, as indicated
below.

For TAP 4 support in TAP 7, these changes are required:
1. [Include map.json file with Initial Trusted Metadata](#tap-4-support-map-json)
2. [Separate metadata and targets in data directories by repository](#tap-4-support-repository-directories)
(in Initial Trusted Metadata and Repository Data)
3. [Organize keys.json by repository](#tap-4-support-keys-json)



#### TAP 4 Support - map.json
[TAP 4](tap4.md) requires that clients have a `map.json` to identify known
repositories and the client's trust relationships with them / delegations to
them (which repositories or combinations of repositories a client trusts to
provide target files in different namespaces. For TAP 4 Support in TAP 7, a
`map.json` file is included in
[Initial Trusted Metadata](#initial-trusted-metadata).

`map.json` normally maps:
1. target file namespaces to (groups of) repository names to trust for those
target files
2. repository names to the locations where clients can find data for each
repository

As normal, the repository
names will tell you which directories will contain relevant test data for a
given repository, and which repository to trust for which targets. See the next
two sections on TAP 4 Support below.

Since test setups vary, however, we cannot in pre-generated test data map the
names of repositories to the locations of mirrors or assume what transport
mechanism will be employed. The locations listed should be corrected to
reflect the real location of the repositories where test data will be made
available to the clients. (In more exotic setups -- for example, if http(s)://
or file:// are not to be used and repository data is distributed through some
other protocol -- the map file should be adjusted to ensure that
the client is able to find the appropriate test data for each repository.)

For example, here is a map file that requires Repository1 and Repository2 to
agree on target file info for targets in `project123/`, trusts Repository3
alone for all other projects, and specifies the (irrelevant for test data)
location of the repositories.

```Javascript
{
  "repositories": {
    "Repository1": [<test_case_0/repo1>],
    "Repository2": [<test_case_0/repo2>],
    "Repository3": ...,
  },
  "mapping": [
    {
      "paths":        ["project123/*"],
      "repositories": ["Repository1", "Repository2"],
      "terminating":  true,
    },
    {
      "paths":        ["*"],
      "repositories": ["Repository3"]
    }
  ]
}
```



#### TAP 4 Support - Repository Directories
When TAP 4 is supported, the structure of the directories of metadata and
targets in the test cases' [Initial Trusted Metadata](#initial-trusted-metadata)
and [Repository Data](#repository-data) changes slightly to organize contents
by repository, using the repository names listed in `map.json`. An extra level of
directories is added, one per repository named in `map.json`, each containing
'metadata' (and in the case of Repository Data, 'targets') directories.


[Initial Trusted Metadata](#initial-trusted-metadata) will now look like this:
  ```
  - map.json // See section above on map.json
  - keys.json
  - <repository_1_name>
              |- metadata
                    |- root.json
                    ...
  - <repository_2_name>
              |- metadata
                    |- root.json
                    ...
  ...
  ```

And [Repository Data](#repository-data) will now look like this:
  ```
  - keys.json
  - <repository_1_name>
              |- metadata
                    |- root.json
                    |- timestamp.json
                    |- snapshot.json
                    |- targets.json
                    |- <a delegated role>.json
                    |- <another delegated role>.json
                    |   ...
              |- targets
                    |- <some_target.img>
                    |-  ...
  - <repository_2_name>
              |- metadata
                    |- root.json
                    |- ...
              |- targets
                    |- ...
  ...
  ```



#### TAP 4 Support - keys.json
When TAP 4 is supported, the `keys.json` file provided in Initial Trusted
Metadata and Repository Data gains an additional level of strucutre at the
root of the dictionary, separating keys by repository, using repository names
from `map.json`, like this:
  ```javascript
  {
    <repository_1_name>: {
      <rolename_1>: [ // This role should be signed by these two keys:
        {'keytype': <type, e.g. 'ed25519'>,
         'keyid': <id string>,
         'keyval': {'public': <key string>, 'private': <key string>},
        },
        {'keytype': <type, e.g. 'ed25519'>,
         'keyid': <id string>,
         'keyval': {'public': <key string>, 'private': <key string>},
        }],
      <rolename_2>: [...]},

    <repository_2_name>: {...}
  }
  ```

   A particular example of `keys.json` with TAP 4 support:

  ```javascript
  {
    'imagerepo': {
      {'root': [{
        'keytype': 'ed25519',
        'keyid': '94c836f0c45168f0a437eef0e487b910f58db4d462ae457b5730a4487130f290',
        'keyval': {
          'public': 'f4ac8d95cfdf65a4ccaee072ba5a48e8ad6a0c30be6ffd525aec6bc078211033',
          'private': '879d244c6720361cf1f038a84082b08ac9cd586c32c1c9c6153f6db61b474957'}}]},
      {'timestamp': [{
        'keytype': 'ed25519',
        'keyid': '6fcd9a928358ad8ca7e946325f57ec71d50cb5977a8d02c5ab0de6765fef040a',
        'keyval': {
          'public': '97c1112bbd9047b1fdb50dd638bfed6d0639e0dff2c1443f5593fea40e30f654',
          'private': 'ef373ea36a633a0044bbca19a298a4100e7f353461d7fe546e0ec299ac1b659e'}}]},
      ...
      {'delegated_role1': [{
        'keytype': 'ed25519',
        'keyid': '8650aed05799a74f5febc9070c5d3e58d62797662d48062614b1ce0a643ee368',

    },
    'director': {
      {'root': [{
        ...
  ```
